# CodSoft Data Science Program

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects completed during the **CodSoft Data Science Internship Program**. The projects include:

- **Iris Classification**
- **Movie Rating Prediction**
- **Titanic Survival Prediction**

Each project demonstrates various data science techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using Python.

## 1. Iris Classification

The **Iris Classification** project is a classic machine learning task that uses the famous Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

### Key Features:
- Dataset: [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
- Classification Models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forests
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### Files:
- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Iris classification analysis.
- `iris_data.csv`: Dataset file.

### Steps:
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data visualization (scatter plots, pair plots)
3. Model training and evaluation

## 2. Movie Rating Prediction

The **Movie Rating Prediction** project predicts user ratings for movies based on various features, such as movie genres, user demographic data, and historical ratings.

### Key Features:
- Dataset: [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
- Regression Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, XGBoost
- Evaluation Metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `matplotlib`

### Files:
- `movie_rating_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the Movie Rating prediction analysis.
- `movielens_data.csv`: Dataset file.

### Steps:
1. Data preprocessing and feature extraction
2. Model selection and training
3. Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation

## 3. Titanic Survival Prediction

The **Titanic Survival Prediction** project predicts which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using the Titanic dataset.

### Key Features:
- Dataset: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `xgboost`

### Files:
- `titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Titanic survival analysis.
- `titanic_data.csv`: Dataset file.

### Steps:
1. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
2. Feature engineering (Pclass, Age, SibSp, Fare, etc.)
3. Model training and evaluation
